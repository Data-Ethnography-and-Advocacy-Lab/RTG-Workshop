::: {.column width="60%"}
-   a collection of data points organized into a structured format
-   we can refer to 2-dimensional datasets as *rectangular* datasets
-   rectangular datasets are organized into a series of rows and columns; ideally:
    -   we refer to rows as *observations*
    -   we refer to columns as *variables*

## Observations vs. Variables vs. Values {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: panel-tabset
### Observations

::: nonincremental
-   Observations refer to individual units or cases of the data being collected.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student in a course, one student would be an observation.
    -   If I was collecting census data and aggregating it at the city level, one city would be an observation.
:::

### Variables

::: nonincremental
-   Variables describe something about an observation.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student in a course, 'age' might be one variable.
    -   If I was collecting city-level census data, 'population' might be one variable.
:::

### Values

::: nonincremental
-   Values refer to the actual value associated with a variable for a given observation.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student's age in a course, one value might be 20.

## Units of Observation

- Represent the unit at which data is recorded or aggregated
- "Each row in the dataset represents a ________."
- Defintions determine "what counts" as a relevant unit

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Types of Variables

| Categorical Variables                                                             | Numeric Variables                                                               |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Named or classified labels (e.g. names, zip codes, hair color) | Counted Variables (e.g. number of students in this class) |
| Ordered labels (e.g. letter grades, pollution levels)          | Measured variables (e.g. temperature, height)             |

## Query a Dataset: What counts?

- For each unit of observation and variable ask:
  - What is the formal definition or standard for this observation or variable? (Denotative Reading)
  - What is the social history of this definition of standard? (Connotative Reading)
  - What relevant information is excluded due to the scope of this definition or variable? (Deconstructive Reading)
  
---

## Where can I find this information?

- Data documentation
- Methodology/FAQ
- News articles, and opinion pieces 
  - Google: "what counts as a _____"s
