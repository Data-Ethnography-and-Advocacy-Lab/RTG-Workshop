-   became the basis for medical guidelines 
-   recommended the prescription of atypicals to treat bipolar children. 

-   more than half of the participants in the drug's trial dropped out due to the drug’s negative side effects.
-   research article argued for the drug’s effectiveness.

-   eventually came under the scrutiny of New York Times investigative reporting. 
-   2007, NYT published article discussing impact of this type of drug on children with bipolar mania. 
-   journalists uncovered that 3/4 of expert panelists paid speaker or consultancy fees by atypical drugmakers.
-   DelBello hired by AstraZeneca to give sponsored talks
-   separately paid by 8 different drug companies, including 5 manufacturers of atypical drugs.

# "Trust me, I don't make much."

:::{.notes}
-   NYT reported how much DelBello earned from the University of Cincinnati, 
-   when asked how much she was earning from drug manufacturers, she responded, “Trust me, I don’t make much.”
-   published when payments coming under federal scrutiny
-   Medicare and Medicaid make up 1/4 of the federal budget 
-   largest payer of pharmaceuticals in the country
-   addressing bipartisan issue. 
-   Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, was at the time serving as the head of the Senate Finance Committee and brought on Paul Thacker as a Lead Investigator. 

-   Thacker reached out to DelBello's university department chair requesting copies of the conflict of interest forms she had filed with the University. 

-   uncovered that DelBello collected 100s of 1000s from AstraZeneca - money that went unreported in the published scientific studies.

-   2008: Chuck Grassley narrated story before Congress
-   introduced a bill called the Physician Payments Sunshine Act
-   require that pharma companies and medical device manufacturersreport the amounts of money they had paid to physicians in a public database. 
-   similar legislation passed in states, but this federal
-   Grassley went on to state, “This bill is not aimed at stopping money flowing to the doctors. …. But it ought to throw a little sunshine on this issue. And that sunshine shown on this issue, I think, will go a long way toward curbing bad behavior” .

-   up until 2012, MA prohibited pharma and device companies from paying doctors meals at all. 
-   2012 amendments allowed for “modest meals” outside of hospital settings to provide doctors with information about certain drugs or devices during meals so as not to pull them away from patient time.
-   five days of the year where more than 15 food and beverage payments were reported on a single day.

## Aims and Overview

-   Examine how datasets are composed to "fix accountability"
  -   How beliefs about the promises of transparency become inscribed into datasets
  -   How stakeholders "fix meaning-making" through data's narrative form
  -   How concerns over data "context" get mobilized in the process
  
:::{.notes}

-   examine how datasets get **configured to “fix accountable futures”** through advocacy and discursive action. I aim to 
-   show how **beliefs about the promises** of transparency become **inscribed in the material-semiotic form** of datasets. 
-   examine what this means for efforts to “fix accountability” 
-   stakeholders seek to **“fix meaning-making”** around accountable practices through **data composition**
-   fix futures where data interpreters draw certain kinds of conclusions from published data. 
-   how mobilized in relation to OP

# Cultural Analysis of Datasets

:::{.notes}
-   Data as system of signs
-   defining feature of dataset is that they structure sign system
-   data have narrative form
-   privilege certain stories over others through ordering obs, selecting vari, dividing cat, policing def, and discerning what counts as context
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Dataset Narrative Form

-   "Tidy" datasets are often understood to be "rectangular."

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

Grolemund, Garrett, and Hadley Wickham. n.d. R for Data Science. Accessed March 31, 2019. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/.

:::{.notes}
-   data analysis systems (such as Excel, R, and Stata) designed w/ the presumption that most datasets will be “rectangular” 
-   Data scientists spend much of their time wrangling messy datasets to make them “tidy” (new row/new column)
-  qual values in datasets are restricted to “controlled vocabularies” 
-   quant values in datasets inscribed according to standards
-   published w/ “contextual information” that frame their contents. 
-   all shape how meaning is drawn from data
-   data can be written in divergent ways 
-   stakeholders craft datasets with speculative visions of future interpretation and data outcomes. 
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Material-Semiotics of Data

-   "Raw data are an oxymoron" (Bowker 2005)
-   Data are not "given" but "captured" (Drucker 2011)
-   Data are "mutable" (Bates et al. 2016)

**How are data narrated in the inscriptive phases of data generation?**


:::{.notes}

-   affirm scholarship 
-   mutable, not static, transform as they move between sites of practice and use. 
-   do not intrinsically reveal stories, but must be narrated
-   data storytelling is one way communities make data actionable. 
-   extend to demonstrate not only how data gets narrated in interpretive phases, but also in inscriptive phases 
-   in the phases where people are deciding the dataset’s narrative form.
-   when they are deciding how data will be configured and presented to the world.

-   work in tradition of cul anth in which literary theory and ethnography are often fused
-   narrative forms of cultural texts are of central concern. 
-   mid-1970s: attention to language structures, tropes, and genres of key cultural texts. 
-   historian and literary critic Hayden White analyzed how verbal structures employed in writing of historical work shaped their broader narratives and arguments, constituting contemporary historical knowledge according to classical tropes of irony, tragedy, and so on.
-   Post-colonial scholars deconstructed key cultural texts, highlighting role of language in shaping colonial power and in rendering certain populations speechless
-   showed how history and culture were not only reflected in texts, but were also constituted through their narrative form.

## Reading Datasets

-   Inspired by critical hermeneutics of digital infrastructure:
    -   Code (Marino 2006)
    -   Databases (Dourish 2014; Feinberg 2017)
    -   Infrastructure (Star 1999)
    -   Algorithms (Burrell 2016; Mackenzie 2017; Seaver 2017)
    -   Machine Learning (Kockelman 2020)
-   Contributes to literature documenting the "genealogies of datasets" (Denton 2020) and ethnographies of data infrastructure (Ribes 2013; Biruk 2018) 

:::{.notes}
- approach work inspired by academic sub-fields have been applying critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of various forms of digital infrastructure. 

-   "code as a text, as a sign system with its own rhetoric"; close reading of digital code

-  scholarship reframes components of digital infrastructures 
-   not only functional tools for holding information, but also as iterating cultural artifacts, privileging certain symbolic orders over others. 

-   also the case w/ datasets

-   echo a growing contingent of scholars calling for new modes of “data criticism” (Beaton 2016), the study of “dataset genealogies” (Denton et al. 2020), the tracing of critical histories of repurposed data (Radin 2017), and the narrating of data stories (Bouk 2022). 
-   literary criticism to datasets.

-   Mary Graham: disclosure as “the third wave of modern risk regulation.”
-   predates open government movements in the late 2000s and early 2010s. 
-   Freedom of Information Laws, or “sunshine laws” that mandate openness in public decision-making
    -   open meetings and records
    -   in place in certain countries around the world for centuries
    -   in certain U.S. states since the early 1900s 
-   1967 FOIA 
    -   following U.S. Watergate scandal, 
    -   public support for governmental transparency prompted the passing of the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976, 
    -   opening of all government meetings, except for those that might result in the disclosure of sensitive or protected information. 

-   Successive amendments to FOIA have responded to changes in social and judicial environments. 
-   1960s and 1970s, laws were passed in the U.S. requiring corporations to disclose information to regulators and concerned publics about their practices. 
-   1975: HMDA - concern over unfair lending practices were contributing to the decline of urban communities, 
    -   1989: Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act amended require that data on applicant and borrower characteristics be collected and disclosed in order to monitor discriminatory lending. 
-   EPCRKA passed in response to 1984 Union Carbide gas leak incident in Bhopal, India,
    -   mandates disclosure of info about hazardous materials and toxic emissions present in communities 

-   2000s: open data movements set the agenda for publishing government information as structured datasets.     -   Sunlight Foundation and the Open Knowledge Foundation: publish machine-readable. 
-   first day in office in 2009, successive executive orders signed by former U.S. President Barack Obama regarding the opening of government datasets 
-   culminated in his signing of the “Open Data Policy” - an Executive Order to make machine-readable open data the default for all government information
-   2018: Open Data Policy codified into law w/ the passing of the Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act. 
-   now many disclosure datasets accessible for download in standardized, tabular formats from open government data portals and agency websites.

## What is the goal of disclosure?

-   Citizen "right-to-know"?
-   Change corrupt business practices?
-   Encourage citizens to self-organize boycotts?
-   Generate empirical evidence of wrong-doing?

:::{.notes}

-   generally understood as contributing to social good
-   purpose subject of much debate. 
-   Do we publish the data because citizens have a “right-to-know” about the goings-on in government and business? 
-   Do we publish the data because we believe doing so will actually change corrupt governing or business practices? 
-   Do we publish the data because we believe citizens will self-organize around boycotting certain actors that have been revealed as “bad actors”? 
-   Or do we publish the data in efforts to generate empirical evidence of wrong-doing - as a first step towards pursuing further regulation? 

-   seem concert with one another
-   explain how disclosure data programs have been able to gain bipartisan support in the United States. 
-   progressive: foreground greedy or discriminatory business practices
    -   first step towards oversight and regulation
-   when treated as an end in and of itself: advance a neoliberal agenda 
    -   diffuse responsibility of public oversight from regulators to citizens. 
    -   why some remain ambivalent

-   a nonprofit organization founded by Thomas Stossel, an oncologist and Professor at the Harvard Medical School
-   ACRE website highlighted condemnation of the “anti-industry movement” in the medical profession
-   long-term goal of: “revers[ing] policies instituted curtailing or minimizing interaction between industry and physicians, educators and researchers” (ACRE, 2010)

> Finally, the most destructive aspect of Sunshine is its flawed premise that every payment presents a conflict of interest. The fact is that payment information can serve either good or bad purposes. The “good” outcome “sunshine” advocates claim is that “transparency” will rein in medical care costs based on the absolutely unproven and arguably false premise that industry payments to physicians drive overprescribing of unnecessary and overly expensive brands. (ACRE Steering Committee, 2012: 3)

Manufacturers and orgs: reporting harm research enterprise, advancement of sci, and patient care by discouraging medical innovation and fostering distrust in medical industries, 
-   ethical problem with epistemic roots : lack of context
-   letter went on no judgments without “context”:
 
> How these data are to be taken in the context of analyzing scientific research is unknown and merely will serve the interests of fascinated individuals (certainly not patients or researchers). Without context, these data cannot be interpreted; intentionality, influence, alleged corruption and causality cannot be defined by the data alone. (ACRE Steering Committee, 2012: 4)

## Transparency-Washing

-   Prioritizing transparency to strengthen brand while detracting from larger concerns (Zalnieriute 2011)
-   Commitments to transparency as "lip service"
-   Transparency can turning responsibility for oversight onto consumers
-   Transparency can be a means of advancing self-regulation

:::{.notes}

-   Monika Zalnieriute (2021): “transparency-washing”
-   companies prioritize the ideal of transparency in order to strengthen their brand, while detracting attention from substantive ethical issues towards smaller scale procedural issues. 
-   “lip service”: identified their own ambivalences about the effectiveness of transparency programs. 
-   Niall Brennan, former Chief Data Officer: divided along party lines
-   transparency initiatives embody a liberal governmentality; 
    -   corporations can evade reg: responsibility for oversight pushed onto a citizenry 
    -   newly expected to review public info and make consumer-based decisions in alignment with their values and priorities. 

-   labeling context became transparency-washing tactic. 
-   had criticized interpretation driven by false or misleading premises - context remedy 
-   referring to context presented language as objective and disinterested --> aimed at truth conclusions not ideological conclusions 
-   ignored situated perspectives producing context 
-   calls often suggested leaving to industries and physicians

    -   secure, the center of meaning-making with the same actors the data was (at least originally) meant to hold accountable.
    -   fix, or repair, potentially biased meaning-making practices by asking CMS to monitor

-   subversive advocacy around contextual perspective
-   calls to bring context through info infra 
-   calls to standardize definitions and clearly demarcate categories for payments.
-   stated goal to promote consistency in reporting
-   community groups: data would be more meaningful to the public when standardized. 
-    appeared to be advocating for fixing the center of mean-making through certain information infrastructures.
-   standards often considered neutral; exonerates actors from blame 
-   effaced judgments always animating infra
-   definitions in fact hotly debated 
-   politics eclipsed as displaced onto info infra

What happened?

-   noted that they would  “accurately and completely” describe the nature of relationships between physicians and industries on their website. 
-   also “to reduce the promotional or company specific information on the Web site” 
-   specific language focused more on what payments did not indicate than what they did indicate.

-   agreed context was a prerequisite to transparency.
-   agreed that transparency was not necessarily about discerning corrupt from legitimate business practices
-   not necessarily about promoting trust in the medical industry. 
-   avoid coming across as passing value judgments on the data’s meaning and significance. 
-   context to nullify preconceived judgments

-   Center for Program Integrity (CPI) 
-   Shantanu Agrawal, a former emergency room doctor who later shifted careers towards health policy, 
    -   Deputy Administrator for CPI 
-   rebrand the program as “Open Payments” in an effort to shift away from the framing of the data as a “disinfectant.” 
 
> We wanted it to be about transparency. And we wanted it to be clear about what it was. We didn't want to continue with this underlying notion that it was intrinsically corrupt. And so we emphasize openness and transparency.

-   reframe the underlying premises consumers might bring to data interpretation
-   not to promote certain interpretations as correct
-   open further interpretive possibilities
-   synonymous with openness: context into a different kind of remedy—not preventing wrong conclusions and more preventing singular ones.

including language warning users against jumping to conclusions on what the data means and doesn’t mean. In this enactment, context (understood to be implicitly designed into the website’s information architecture) would not determine interpretation, but could facilitate it.

# Conclusions 

::: {.incremental}
-   "Context" can be deployed towards fixing interpretive outcomes
-   A "tyranny of light" is that it can become a means of concealment
-   Critical scholars of data should attend to the narrative forms of datasets
:::

:::{.notes}

-   context became a means of at times controlling (and at other times relinquishing control over) the frames of reference from which data would be assigned meaning. 
-   numbers could not and should not speak for themselves, -   differed in their articulations and justifications around who or what should speak for numbers
    -   around where meaning should originate. 
    
-   Critical theorists: both the contradictions and consequences of attempts to fix centers of meaning-making,
    -   centered structures both enable and delimit free-play in signification 
    -   stakeholders positioned themselves along this paradox, 
    -   tightening and loosening the centering structures governing meaning-making.
    -   determining interpretation and at other times a means of facilitating interpretation.

-   deemed as making transparency possible - of bringing sunshine to physician payments. 
-   Light, Haridimos Tsoukas (1997): metaphor for knowledge since the enlightenment, marking an increased ability to see. 
-   Transparency: tenet of modern information societies—societies 
-   “tyrannies of light”: surplus of information may obscure what it is meant to represent.
-   opportunities to misrepresent multiply when info is serving as surrogate 
-   context: regulates these spaces of menaing-making 
-   further capacity to eclipse
-   evade perceptions of judgment and open interpretive possibilities: deregulate these meaning-making spaces, in the process propagating possible meanings that could be assigned to data.
-   both enactments of context, the visibility of information can establish the conditions of possibility for concealment (Strathern, 2000). 
-   When deployed to explain away what is made visible through transparency initiatives or in refusal of assigning judgment to data, context can multiply opportunities for misrepresentation. 

This is why it is so critical to attend to the narrative forms of datasets. While discourse suggesting data to be self-evident can certainly be traced through headlines, marketing campaigns, and materials produced by major funding organizations, focusing exclusively on these examples as representative of dominant data epistemologies eclipses other, seemingly contrasting but equally dominating, portrayals of data. Since I started this manuscript, I’ve seen discourse around data ‘context’ weaponized to impede data sharing in a number of communities. Raising concerns over the inclusion of “mining” in the categories U.S. industrial emitters are required to report to the public, companies have expressed concern that the public will take the data out of context (Cray, 2000). Providing testimony on their views on data management, the U.S. International Association of Chiefs of Police cited the risks of sharing data with the public noting that, taken out of context, the data could be misleading (Task Force on 21st Century Policing, 2015). Many business groups oppose pay transparency initiatives in California, citing concerns that the data will be taken out of context (Gedye, 2022). In the case of Open Payments, not only was data context deemed a priority by some of the most powerful data stakeholders; it was also strategically operationalized by certain stakeholders to re-situate explanatory power over the data’s significance. Attending to the advocacy that shapes the narrative forms of databases demonstrates how datasets are deployed, not only to document practices, but also to fix data interpretation, to fix data-based meaning-making, and to fix accountability.
