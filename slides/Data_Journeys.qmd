## Premises: The Life of Data

-   Data move through various sites of data practice (conceptualization, production, analysis, use, etc)
-   Data is socially constituted at each of these different sites
-   Data has material-semiotic qualities, moving within physical spaces

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## "Journeys" vs. "Flows"

-   Attends to moments of mutability
-   Recognizes the stopping points, dead ends, frictions
-   Reminds the ethnographer that they are along for the ride

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Attending to the Spatial Dynamics of Movement

-   Pathways from Point A to Point B
-   Time and speed of movement
-   Moments when data movements are forked or integrated
-   Frictions of movement
